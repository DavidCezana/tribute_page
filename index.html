			<h3>Here's a time line of Spartacus's life:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>109BC - </strong>Spartacus is born in Thrace</li>
				<li><strong>78BC - </strong>Spartacus serves as soldier in the Roman Army as an auxiliary
				</li>
				<li><strong>73BC - </strong>Spartacus became a slave and trained as a lightly armed Roman gladiator referred to as a Thracian.</li>
				<li><strong>73BC - </strong>Spartacus escapes from the gladiator school with 70-80 slave gladiators</li>
				<li><strong>73BC - </strong>The small group of gladiators plunder and pillage around the area and are quickly joined by large numbers of slaves, who flock to him from all quarters. He is soon at the head of a formidable slave army</li>
				<li><strong>73BC - </strong>The praetor Clodius Glaber, with 3,000 soldiers, are sent by the Senate from Rome to quell the slave revolt. The over confident Glaber and his troops are defeated by the slave army</li>
				<li><strong>72BC - </strong>After the success over Glaber many more runaway slaves join Spartacus and his gladiator army swelling the number to 30,000 escaped slaves. The slave army splits, separating into ranks according to their natural languages.</li>
				<li><strong>72BC - </strong>Spartacus keeps the slave army together moving to southern Italy where they can hire pirate ships to Sicily (the location of the first 2 Servile Wars). The slave army defeats two more Roman legions under Marcus Licinius Crassus</li>
				<li><strong>71BC - </strong>Crassus tries to trap Spartacus and his slave army at Calabria by building a ditch with a wall, nearly sixty kilometers long and five meters wide across the 'toe' of Italy from sea to sea</li>
				<li><strong>71BC - </strong>Battle at the River Silarus. This is believed to be the final battle and the death of Spartacus. The body of Spartacus is never found</li>
				<li><strong>71BC - </strong>5,000 slaves escape capture and flee north.</li>
			</ul>

				<p>"A slave who defied the Roman Empire for over two years, Spartacus defeated and humiliated their forces, leading his growing army of slaves, gladiators and desperados to victory. His skill as a tactician was exemplary, his leadership inspirational, and his many escapes from desperate situations left his enemies dumbfounded."</p>
